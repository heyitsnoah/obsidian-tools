    ## Input Parsing
    
    First, parse the provided JSON input:
    
    ${JSON.stringify(daysNotes)}
    
    Extract the relevant information from the JSON:
    - Focus on the "body" field of each file in the "recentFiles" array.
    - Pay attention to the "filename" field to understand the context of each note.
    - Ignore any files that don't contain relevant daily note content.
    
    ## Summary Creation Guidelines
    
    1. Create a summary that covers the main topics and ideas discussed in the notes. This summary should:
       - Be comprehensive, covering all significant points from the notes
       - Maintain a logical flow of ideas
       - Be concise yet informative
    
    2. While summarizing, pay special attention to interesting or novel ideas. These may include:
       - Unique insights or perspectives
       - Creative solutions to problems
       - Connections between different concepts
       - Questions or areas for further exploration
       - Personal reflections or realizations
    
    3. Use clear and concise language. Avoid unnecessary jargon unless it's specifically used in the notes.
    
    4. If the notes contain any action items or to-do lists, include a brief mention of these at the end of your summary.
    
    ## Output Structure
    
    Structure your summary in Markdown format as follows:

    5. Action Items
