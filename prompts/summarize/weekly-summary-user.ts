You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a comprehensive weekly summary for ${process.env.YOUR_NAME}. Use the provided daily summaries to create an insightful, strategic, and actionable weekly overview. Your output should be in JSON format and include the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Key Developments and Trends
3. Strategic Insights
4. Challenges and Opportunities
5. Goals for Next Week
6. Long-term Implications

## Current Week and Context

Week: ${weekStartDate} to ${weekEndDate}

${additionalContext ? `Additional context: ${additionalContext}` : ''}

## Input

Analyze the following daily summaries:

${formatDailySummaries(dailySummaries)}

## Instructions

1. Carefully review all provided daily summaries.
2. Identify overarching patterns, trends, and significant developments across the week.
3. Synthesize information to derive strategic insights and implications.
4. Assess challenges faced and opportunities that emerged during the week.
5. Determine high-level goals and focus areas for the coming week based on the week's developments.
6. Consider the long-term implications of the week's events and insights.

## Output

Generate a JSON object with the following structure (return only the JSON and no other output):

{
  "executiveSummary": "String containing 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the week's key points, major developments, and overall direction",
  "keyDevelopmentsAndTrends": [
    "Array of strings, each representing a significant development or trend observed across the week"
  ],
  "strategicInsights": [
    "Array of strings, each describing a strategic insight derived from the week's events and information"
  ],
  "challengesAndOpportunities": {
    "challenges": [
      "Array of strings, each describing a challenge identified during the week"
    ],
    "opportunities": [
      "Array of strings, each describing an opportunity that emerged or was identified during the week"
    ]
  },
  "goalsForNextWeek": [
    "Array of strings, each describing a high-level goal or focus area for the coming week"
  ],
  "longTermImplications": [
    "Array of strings, each describing a potential long-term implication or consideration based on the week's developments"
  }
}

## Guidelines

1. Executive Summary: Provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of the week's key points. Focus on major developments, overall trends, and the general direction of work and thoughts throughout the week.

2. Key Developments and Trends: Identify the most significant events, changes, or patterns that emerged across the week. These should be broader than individual daily occurrences and represent important shifts or consistencies in focus, progress, or challenges.

3. Strategic Insights: Synthesize information from across the week to derive higher-level insights. These should go beyond summarizing individual ideas and instead represent new understandings or perspectives gained from looking at the week as a whole.

4. Challenges and Opportunities: Assess both the difficulties faced during the week and the potential positive developments or openings that emerged. Consider both immediate and potential future impacts.

5. Goals for Next Week: Based on the week's developments, identify high-level objectives or areas of focus for the coming week. These should be strategic rather than tactical, setting the overall direction rather than detailing specific tasks.

6. Long-term Implications: Consider how the week's events, insights, and developments might impact long-term projects, goals, or strategies. Look for potential far-reaching consequences or shifts in thinking that could influence future decisions or directions.

## Final Notes

- Elevate the discussion beyond day-to-day details to focus on weekly and longer-term patterns and implications.
- Strive for depth and strategic insight rather than a simple aggregation of daily summaries.
- Don't hesitate to make bold connections or propose innovative ideas, as long as they're grounded in the week's information and developments.
- If certain days lack substantial content, focus on extracting value from the available information and identifying any patterns in the gaps or less productive periods.`
